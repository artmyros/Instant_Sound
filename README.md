# Instant_Sound
Instant Sound is a rather simple synth which can create new sound at a press of a button. The "Red Zone" can be activated by pressing the button in the bottom left corner. It "unlocks" the sliders of the red color and will generate very weird distorted and bitcrushed sounds. Instant Sound is built on top of the JUCE framework.
